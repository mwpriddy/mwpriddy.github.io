In December 2013, GT-ASEE forwarded a call for applications for an NSF-funded project, [Engineering Education Pioneers and Trajectories of Impact](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1263512), that was interviewing pioneers (e.g. early leaders) of the engineering education community.  The program leaders were looking for participants that could perform the interviews and aid in analyzing the data.  At this point, I was starting to get interested in 'how' engineering education research was performed, so I filled out the application and was lucky enough to be one of the 32 graduate students selected to be a Pioner Interviewer. 

Starting in January 2014, we attended monthly teleconference meetings to discuss the various aspects of the project, including the motivation and purpose of the project, the proper procedure for performing research interviews, and the aggregation of our interview results.  We also wrote a profile about our specific pioneer that is planned to be made available online, along with the [profiles of all of the other pioneers](http://depts.washington.edu/celtweb/pioneers-wp/).

The capstone of this project was a half-day workshop in Indianapolis the day before the 2014 ASEE National Conference.  In attendance were the program leaders from the University of Washington, all of the interviewers, and a handful of pioneers.  We were brought together to discuss our individual findings and to aid in the search for common themes and conclusions among the various engineering education pathways.  This also lead to a general discussion about some of the transformations made in engineering education.

It was extremely interesting to see how qualitative research is performed and I have to say that I quite enjoyed the change-of-pace it provided.  Hearing the story of my specific pioneer was very motivating to my potential future in academia; he was making active learning changes in the classroom long before most people thought they were needed or useful to student learning.  Additionally, I made some new colleagues within the engineering education community that I hope to collaborate with in the future!
