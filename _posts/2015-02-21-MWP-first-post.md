I am really excited to build a website on github.  I think this should be really useful for integrating all of my research projects with my website.

I just want to check and see what the main blog page does with this information.  I wonder how many lines should be in here and get displayed?  The standard page is really wide; I can see why some of the templates have things on the side, such as categories or tags.  I am really enjoying learning html; I feel this could be a good skill moving forward.  I also look forward to using Markdown to generate more posts!

To insert a picture that is automatically sized for the width of the blog, follow the code for the image below.

[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) is also turned on, so the text below should display as a multi-line equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

I wonder what else we can do with this?
