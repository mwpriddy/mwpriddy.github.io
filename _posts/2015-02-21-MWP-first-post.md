I am really excited to build a website on github.  I think this should be really useful for integrating all of my research projects with my website.

I just want to check and see what the main blog page does with this information.  I wonder how many lines should be in here and get displayed?  The standard page is really wide; I can see why some of the templates have things on the side, such as categories or tags.  I am really enjoying learning html; I feel this could be a good skill moving forward.  I also look forward to using Markdown to generate more posts!
