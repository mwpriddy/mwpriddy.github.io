GT-ASEE hosted our 3rd annual STEM Education Research Expo yesterday and the event was a great success!  We had approximately 30 posters presentations and a total of 60 attendees for the 2-hour poster session.  And, for the first time, we formally invited presenters from other institutions ([Clemson](http://www.clemson.edu/ese/) and [Georgia State University](http://esc.education.gsu.edu)).  We were lucky enough to have 6 presenters from Clemson and 2 from GSU attend the Research Expo, which made the event seem even more legitimate because of the outside presence.

We got off to an uncertain start this week because of the weather situation we have been dealing with in ATL for the last few days.  GT was closed all day on Wednesday and until noon on Thursday, so we were unsure of the amount of attendence we would have yesterday afternoon from 4-6pm.  Luckily, the group from Clemson was still able to travel down and the majority of our presenters were not deterred.  

Additionally, our event corresponded with a Northrop Grumman (NG) meet-and-greet in the Klaus Atrium, due to campus being closed the day before.  Our event space wasn't as large as we would've hoped for, but we met some amazing people from NG and are hoping to collaborate with them in the future, due to our mutual interest in ASEE and advancing engineering education.

This was my 3rd Research Expo to plan and it seems like 3 is the magic number.  We were extremely happy with the [Klaus Atrium](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/about/facilities/klausevents/atrium).  Even though it is open to multiple floors, the acoustics are really quite good.  The quality of food provided by [Rising Roll](http://www.risingroll.com) was on par with what we were expecting, even though this was our first time to hire them.

This will most likely be my last Research Expo to plan, but I can honestly say I will miss it.  I don't get that many opportunities to interact with researchers outside of my technical focus, so these types of events are always really stimulating.
