Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together.
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

hopefully the lowercase filename fixes my problem.  Had to rename it.

I am ready to get this finished.  ugh.
