Members of the GT community had the distinct honor of hosting President Barack Obama at McCamish Pavilion yesterday as he gave a 40-minute impassioned speech about college affordability.  

President Obama spoke to the attendees, most of us were GT students, about the need for an educated workforce and the responsibility we have to improve the state of our nation.  He also spoke about the burden that educational loans have placed on college graduates and how it is hampering our ability to solve the big challenges of tomorrow.  His take on education is quite simple:

> "I believe that America is not a place where higher education is a privilege that is reserved for the few.  America needs to be a place where higher education has to be available for every single person who’s willing to strive for it, who’s willing to work for it."

Towards the end of his speech, he proposed a [Student Aid Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/10/fact-sheet-student-aid-bill-rights-taking-action-ensure-strong-consumer-) that includes four action items:

1. Every student deserves access to a quality, affordable education at a college that’s cutting costs and increasing learning.   
2. Every student should be able to access the resources needed to pay for college. 
3. Every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan. 
4. And every borrower has the right to quality customer service, reliable information, and fair treatment, even if they struggle to repay their loans.

His speech was both inspirational and motivating because he was here, visiting Atlanta, telling us that we can make a difference in the future of America.  With research deadlines and the constant anxiety of generating publishable results always looming over, it can be easy to lose perspective about our individual purpose and societal capabilities.  President Obama reminded us about both of those today.
