<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Woodruff School for Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech. To tell you a little more about my academic history:</p>

<p>Prior Education:</p>
<p> 2008: B.S. in Civil Engineering (minor in Mathematics) from Mississippi State University</p>
<p> 2010: M.S. in Civil Engineering from Mississippi State University</p>
<p>The full story goes something like this…</p>
<p>
I became really interested in materials research after working with Dr. Philip Gullett on some MD simulations during the summer of 2007. That summer job prospered into an undergraduate research position, which later became a graduate research assistantship while I pursued my Master’s degree at Mississippi State.
</p>
<p>
I also became interested in post-secondary education during my time as an undergraduate student. I have always had an interest in helping people learn new things, and I was starting to realize the value of effective instruction for students and how that helped them in subsequent courses.
</p>
<p>
When I finished my M.S., I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in engineering so that I can have a career in academia and pursue my research and teaching interests.
