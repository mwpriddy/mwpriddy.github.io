            <p class="lead">I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Woodruff School for Mechanical Engineering at the  Georgia Institute of Technology. I am studying computational solid mechanics with an emphasis on the crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) and the generation of constitutive relations for lightweight metals, such as Ti or Mg.  </p>

            <p class="lead">I became interested in materials research after working with Dr. Philip Gullett on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of aluminum triple junctions during the summer of 2007. That summer job prospered into an undergraduate research position, which later became a graduate research assistantship while I pursued my Masterâ€™s degree at Mississippi State.  When I finished my M.S., I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in engineering so that I can have a career in academia and pursue my research and teaching interests.</p>

            <p class="lead">I also became interested in post-secondary education during my time as an undergraduate student. I have always had an interest in helping people learn new things, and I was starting to realize the value of effective instruction for students and how that helped them in subsequent courses.</p>
