=====================
This is a personal website for Matthew Priddy.  

In terms of recognition for the current formatting, I would like to credit the following sources:
- [Jonathan McGlone's step-by-step beginners guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) for creating and hosting a personal website using GitHub and Jekyll. 
- [Half Slider from Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/half-slider/) for the initial formatting of the main and individual pages.
- [Modern Business from Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/) for some of the formatting of the main and individual pages.
