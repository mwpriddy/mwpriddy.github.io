=====================
This is a personal website for Matthew Priddy.  

In terms of recognition for the current formatting, I would like to credit the following sources:
- [Jonathan McGlone's step-by-step beginners guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) for creating and hosting a personal website using GitHub and Jekyll. 
- [Half Slider from Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/half-slider/) for the initial formatting of the main and individual pages.
- [Modern Business from Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/) for some of the formatting of the main and individual pages.
- The [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) social media icons are used in this site, with a little bit of help from a [bootstrapbay blog post](http://bootstrapbay.com/blog/font-awesome/).
- This [blog by Justin James](http://digitaldrummerj.me/monthview/) helped to develop my posts page and its organization.
- [Blog Home from Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-home) for some of the posts page formatting.
